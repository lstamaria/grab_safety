# Detecting Dangerous Driving Using Telematics Data

The project objective is to predict dangerous driving using telematics data. Specifically, the project aims to:

1. Provide Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset
1. Build predictive model using machine learning algorithm
1. Evaluate the predictive model using performance measures
 

## Getting Started

Make a copy of the project using SSH or HTTP:

Using SSH
```
git clone git@gihub.com:lstamaria/grab_safety.git
```

Using HTTP
```
git clone https://github.com/lstamaria/grab_safety.git
```

After cloning the repo, locate the directory on your local machine:
```
cd grab_safety
```

You can now explore any portion of the project.
